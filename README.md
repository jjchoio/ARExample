# ARExample
Example project with AR Foundation


Scenario:

1. Once the app starts, scan to find a planar surface in the real world, for example, desk.
   note: scanned mesh is NOT visualized, but you will see the arrow icon on the scanned surface.

2. Tap anywhere on the screen to spawn Rocket. The arrow icon will disappear.

3. The UI will appear (single button for now).

4A. Press hold the button to fire up the Rocket upward.

4B. If you release the button, the Rocket will stop the thrust and start to fall.



Next Step:
Implement a virtual joystick to control the Rocket to fly around the scanned physical space.
If crashed, the Rocket will explode.
